excerpt: "Money is an astounding thing because it can convert anything into
almost anything else. Money also is incredibly open-minded — it spans every
culture, and refrains from discriminating about religion, gender, race, age or
sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other, and
don’t trust each other, can nevertheless cooperate."

Why do you follow rules? You follow rules because everyone else does. You follow
the rules because they benefit you. Computers don’t work for you unless you
follow the rules — point and click, drag and drop, type and hit enter. In
general, different rules encourage different outcomes. Monopoly’s rules create
frustration. Football’s rules generate spectacle. DNA’s rules create all sorts
of interesting life. **Blockchain’s rules allow trusted interactions to happen
on the internet.** Nobody has to follow these rules, but if we do, there’s much
to gain.

In this post, I’ll offer up a physical model for blockchain: the **PaperChain**.
This simplistic model should let you get a sense for how it works. Think of this
picture when you think of blockchain. **PaperChain** is just a stack of paper in
a box. Anyone can put paper in, as long as the paper follows the rules.

What sorts of documents require a precedence stamp before they’re recognized by
your government? Most forms of ownership, such as: copyright, property,
inventions, money, licenses, trades, votes. Before the internet, all of these
documents were paper kept in a box by governments, companies, and people.
**Literally every aspect of civilization is now dependent on this abstraction
for storing and retrieving documents. These documents negotiate our relationship
to society.**

Anyone can add pieces of paper — documents — to the **PaperChain** box. As soon
as everyone has verified that a piece of paper follows the rules, it is placed
in the box forever. **Everyone can see** the papers once they’re in the box, and
**no one can delete or modify** the papers once they’re added.

Just like the fly caught in amber, each paper carries the exact time we all
agreed that it was valid and should be put in the box. As the world ages,
successive layers of amber coat the fly, demonstrating its age. So, too, with
**PaperChain** — layers of timestamped and verified paper.

Let’s keep ignoring the specific rules we’re enforcing — what could we do with
this **PaperChain**? What sort of outcomes do these rules enable?

Imagine I’m trying to buy renters insurance for my apartment. The agency needs
to see a lease signed by my landlord and me. Happily, we live in the era of
**PaperChain**. No longer do I snap a picture and email it. Instead, a year back
I added a copy of my lease to the **PaperChain** box, so I just inform the
agency of the date it was accepted. **PaperChain** bakes all the trust and
reliability into the rules, so the agency only needs to trust
**PaperChain** — not the people involved. As long as everyone enforces the rules
properly, **PaperChain** is incorruptible.
