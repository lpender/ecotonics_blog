Add superpowers to on your on-chain logic at ETHDenver

Hackers of ETHDenver,

Ever wish you could enable your on-chain logic to depend on complex external events? Here at Rhombus we've been working on building an oracle platform to take care of all our off-chain needs with the highest level of reliability, security, and computability.

Oracle services are vital components of the Smart Contract stack, and the Rhombus software stack balances the complexity of external data sourcing and aggregation against the trustless needs of our fellow decentralized hackers.

Here at Rhombus, we have curated the best data feeds across a wide range of external events: weather, macroeconomic indicators, supply chain, flight, finance, and satellite imagery -- to name a few. We package this data with best-in-class computational tools -- including the latest in machine learning and AI. No matter what your contract needs to know about "what's happening" -- you can depend on our platform to deliver it.

On top of all that, Rhombus makes it easy for you to build. At ETHDenver, we'll be releasing a Truffle Box which shows you how to test and build against our oracles in your local environment. For the hackathon, you'll be able to build on top of several different feeds (or a custom one if you come up to us at our booth).

Rhombus is already enabling the world of decentralized insurance (HurricaneGuard), finance (OpenLaw), and prediction markets (Gnosis). We're confident you'll find our platform intuitive, easy, fun, and powerful!

Start exploring our documentation or reach out to us. We're so excited to see what you'll build.
